This page provides an overview of New Relic's Prometheus integration options and how they work. The information here will help you choose from among our options based on which one best fits your unique business needs.

## Prometheus OpenMetrics, Prometheus agent, or remote write integration? [#pomi-remote_write]

We currently offer two integration options: [Prometheus remote write integration](#remote-write) and [Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker](#OpenMetrics).

We recommend getting started with the remote write integration if you already have a Prometheus server install base. If you find it hard to manage your Prometheus cluster, or if you are getting started with integrating Prometheus Metrics, you should use OpenMetrics.

Examine the benefits, reminders, and recommendations for each option below.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="remote-write-integration"
    title="Prometheus remote write integration"
  >
    Benefits:

    * Easy access to your combined metrics in New Relic if you already have Prometheus servers. Access only takes one line of yaml in your Prometheus configuration.

    * Access your metrics through both New Relic and Prometheus without making additional adjustments in Prometheus.

    * Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source.

    * Prometheus [High Availability support](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/install-configure/prometheus-high-availability-ha): We de-duplicate data from HA-pairs on ingest.

      Reminders:

    * You will need to manage your Prometheus servers.

    * You can reduce your storage retention.

    * Fewer query loads to the server.

      Recommendations:

    * Evaluate your observability needs to manage your data volumes better.

    * The [scrape interval](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#scrape_config) is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from 15s (default value) to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%.

    * Set your filters and configure data to target (see [metrics or targets](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#relabel_action)).

    * Balance remote writes between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="prometheus-agent"
    title="New Relic's Prometheus agent"
  >
    Benefits:

    * Configures Prometheus agent for you to send metrics to the Remote Write endpoint

    * Federation: Allows you to combine data from multiple servers into a single source.

    * Prometheus Sharding. See how to [scale Prometheus agent instances](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/scale-prometheus-instances).

    * No need for local storage.

    Recommendations:

    * The [scrape interval](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/setup-prometheus-agent#target-scrape-interval#target_scrape_interval) is the biggest factor influencing data volumes: select it based on your observability needs. For example, changing from the default value of 15s to 30s can reduce data volumes by 50%.

    * Set your filters and configure data to target. See how to [filter Prometheus metrics](/docs/infrastructure/prometheus-integrations/install-configure-prometheus-agent/filter-prometheus-metrics).

    * Balance remote writes between one or more New Relic accounts or sub-accounts to manage rate limits.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="openmetrics-integration"
    title="Prometheus OpenMetrics integration for Kubernetes or Docker"
  >
    Benefits:

    * Best for an alternative to Prometheus servers

    * Store all your metrics directly in New Relic

    * No need to manage any Prometheus servers yourself.

    * No need for local storage.

      Reminders:

    * Slightly more complex setup.

    * No support for High Availability replicas.

    * The Kubernetes operator is not available for enhanced operations automation.

</CollapserGroup>

Regardless of the option you chose, with our Prometheus integrations:

* You can use Grafana or other query tools via New Relic's Prometheus' API.
* You benefit from more [nuanced security and user management options](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).
* New Relic's [database](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/nrdb-horsepower-under-hood) can be the centralized long-term data store for all your Prometheus metrics, allowing you to observe all your data in one place.
* You can execute queries to scale, supported by New Relic.

## Prometheus remote write integration [#remote-write]

Unlike [Kubernetes](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/get-started/new-relic-prometheus-openmetrics-integration-kubernetes) and [Docker](/docs/integrations/prometheus-integrations/get-started/new-relic-prometheus-openmetrics-integration-docker) OpenMetrics integrations, which scrape data from Prometheus endpoints, the remote write integration allows you to forward [telemetry data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/capabilities/get-know-telemetry-data-platform) from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. You can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and beyond.

### Scale your data and get moving quickly [#remote-write-scale]

With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can:

* Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform
* Combine and group data across your entire software stack
* Get a fully connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you're monitoring
* Connect your [Grafana dashboards](/docs/integrations/grafana-integrations/get-started/grafana-support-prometheus-promql) (optional).

### How it works [#remote-write-how-works]

[Signing up for New Relic](https://newrelic.com/signup) is fast and free â€” we won't even ask for a credit card number. Once logged in, you can get data flowing with a few simple steps.

## Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations [#OpenMetrics]

New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations for Docker and Kubernetes allow you to scrape [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) endpoints and send the data to New Relic, so you can store and visualize crucial metrics on one platform.

With these integrations, you can:

* Automatically identify a static list of endpoints.
* Collect metrics that are important to your business.
* Query and visualize this data in the New Relic UI.
* Connect your [Grafana dashboards](/docs/integrations/grafana-integrations/get-started/grafana-support-prometheus-promql) (optional).

### Reduce overhead and scale your data [#OpenMetrics-reduce-overhead]

Collect, analyze, and visualize your metrics data from any source, alongside your telemetry data, so you can correlate issues all in one place. Out-of-the-box integrations for open-source tools like Prometheus make it easy to get started, and eliminate the cost and complexity of hosting, operating, and managing additional monitoring systems.

Prometheus OpenMetrics integrations gather all your data in one place, and New Relic stores the metrics from Prometheus. This integration helps remove the overhead of managing storage and availability of the Prometheus server.

To learn more about how to scale your data without the hassles of managing Prometheus and a separate dashboard tool, see New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics integration [blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/how-to-monitor-prometheus-metrics/).

    In a Kubernetes environment, New Relic automatically discovers the endpoints in the same way that the Prometheus Kubernetes collector does it. The integration looks for the `prometheus.io/scrape` annotation or label. You can also identify additional static endpoints in the configuration.
